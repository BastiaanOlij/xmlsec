- Unify password callback (one of parameters: filename)
- Windows, nmake check.
    1) I would like to execute test suite for all available 
    xmlsec-crypto libs on Windows (in the same way as we do it on Linux). 
    2) Since the working directory is xmlsec/win32, instead of
    xmlsec, some files with keys are not found. (Causes raw-cert
    sig test to fail, for example.)
    3) Thirdly the command diff is used, but this may result into
    finding differences in files simply because of the original
    file may have lf and the newly generated files have crlf as
    linebreaks.
    5) Create platform independent test files format and generate
    test*.sh, test*.bat, etc scripts "on the fly".
    6) Fix /tmp issue: if the folder path is=/tmp/<filename>, 
    for cygwin the absolute path to /tmp/<filename> is 
    c:\cygwin\tmp\<filename>. The windows application,xmlsec.exe 
    in this case, gets the same path (/tmp/<filename>) andcreates 
    there the file. However for xmlsec.exe, that runs outside 
    cygwin environment, the absolute path is: C:\tmp\<filename>. 
    After creation theshell script takes over and does some checks, 
    but then can't find the,since it's located at another position. 
    So in the first place c:\tmpfolder *must* exist to run the dsig 
    tests, and the diff command in theenc test script will fail because 
    it can't find the files.
