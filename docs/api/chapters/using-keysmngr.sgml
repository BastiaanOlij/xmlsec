        <title>Keys and keys manager.</title>
	<para>A key in XML Security Library is a representation of the 
	&lt;dsig:KeyInfo/&gt; element and consist of several key data objects. 
	The "value" key data usually contains raw key material (or handlers to 
	key material) required to execute particular crypto transform. Other 
	key data objects may contain any additional information about the key. 
	All the key data objects in the key are associated with the same key 
	material. For example, if a DSA key material has both an X509 
	certificate and a PGP data associated with it then such a key can 
	have a DSA key "value" and two key data objects for X509 certificate 
	and PGP key data.

	<para>XML Security Library has several "invisible" key data classes. 
	These classes never show up in the keys data list of a key but are used 
	for &lt;dsig:KeyInfo/&gt; children processing (&lt;dsig:KeyName/&gt;, 
	&lt;dsig:EncryptedKey/&gt;, ...). As with transforms, application might 
	add any new key data objects or replace the default ones.
	</para>
	<para>Processing some of the key data objects require additional 
	information which is global across the application (or in the 
	particular area of the application). For example, X509 certificates 
	processing require a common list of trusted certificates to be 
	available. XML Security Library keeps all the common information 
	for key data processing in a a collection of key data stores called 
	"keys manager".

	<para>Keys manager has a special "keys store" which lists the keys 
	known to the application. This "keys store" is used by XML Security 
	Library to lookup keys by name, type and crypto algorithm (for example,
	during &lt;dsig:KeyName/&gt; processing). The XML Security Library 
	provides default "flat list" based implementation of a simple keys 
	store. The application can replace it with any other keys store 
	(for example, based on an SQL database).
	</para>
	<para>Keys manager is the only object in XML Security Library which 
	is supposed to be shared by many different operations. Usually keys 
	manager is initialized once at the application startup and later is 
	used by XML Security library routines in "read-only" mode. If 
	application or crypto function need to modify any of the key data 
	stores inside keys manager then proper synchronization must be 
	implemented. In the same time, application can create a new keys 
	manager each time it needs to perform XML signature, verification, 
	encryption or decryption.
