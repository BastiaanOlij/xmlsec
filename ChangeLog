    * The result of operation (sign/verify) is returned in the
      list of xmlDSigSignature objects. Application can examine
      the key and signature method, content just before digesting or
      signing, etc. and decide what to do with it.
    * The Transform and KeyInfo code was significantly re-written and 
      separated from the XMLDSig code with a goal to reuse in in 
      XML Signature or whatever.
    * Added support for RetrievalMethod and Manifests (pretty simple
      adter the first change because both are based on Transforms)
    * Added XSLT support (based on libxslt from Daniel Veillard)
